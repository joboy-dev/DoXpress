# DoXpress

This is an application that allows you to easily organnize tasks. This application was built with HTML, CSS, Flask, and JavaScript.

As the user, you have the ability to do the following:
1. Create an account.
2. Logi to your account.
3. Create todo tasks.
4. Edit your todo tasks.
5. When youve completed a todo, you can mark it as complete. Once this is done, the todo can only be deleted.
6. Delete your todo tasks.

Now, if a user does not complete a task before the set date and time of completion, the task will be marked as expired and the user will be limited to just deleting the todo.
